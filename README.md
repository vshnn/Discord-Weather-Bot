# Discord-Weather-Bot
A Discord weather bot using Python and the OpenWeatherMap API. The bot provides real-time weather updates and forecasts for any location in the world by responding to user commands, such as !weather [city name].
The bot fetches weather data from the API and displays temperature, humidity, wind speed, and conditions in the chat channel. It also alerts users of severe weather conditions.
The project involved working with APIs, JSON parsing, error handling, and integration with the Discord API using the Discord.py library. The bot was deployed on a cloud platform, ensuring 24/7 availability.
