# Discord Weather Bot ðŸ¤–
#### A Discord weather bot using Python and the OpenWeatherMap API. The bot provides real-time weather updates and forecasts for any location in the world by responding to user commands, such as ```!weather [city name]``` and ```!forecast [city name]```
#### The bot fetches weather data from the API and displays temperature, humidity, wind speed, and conditions in the chat channel. It also alerts users of severe weather conditions.
#### The project involved working with APIs, JSON parsing, error handling, and integration with the Discord API using the Discord.py library. The bot was deployed on a cloud platform, ensuring 24/7 availability.
